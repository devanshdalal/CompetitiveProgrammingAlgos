  <p> There is an ancient legend in China called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranka_(legend)">Ranka</a></p> 
  <p> (Content taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranka_(legend)">wikipedia</a>) <br> Wang Chih was a hardy young fellow who used to venture deep into the mountains to find suitable wood for his axe.<br> One day he went farther than usual and became lost. He wandered about for a while and eventually came upon two strange old men<br> who were playing Go, their board resting on a rock between them. Wang Chih was fascinated. He put down his axe and began to watch.<br> One of the players gave him something like a date to chew on, so that he felt neither hunger nor thirst. As he continued to watch he<br> fell into a trance for what seemed like an hour or two. When he awoke, however, the two old men were no longer there.<br> He found that his axe handle had rotted to dust and he had grown a long beard. When he returned to his native village he discovered<br> that his family had disappeared and that no one even remembered his name. </p> 
  <p> So how could that happen? Well, that's because the game "Go" can played very long. </p> 
  <p> Let's first define the game "Go": </p> 
  <p> In this game, we focus on the game played on a 9x9 board. It is a game played by 2 players.<br> A plays black stone while B plays white. They play alternatively. A goes first.<br> In each cell there can be 3 states: empty, having 1 black stone and having 1 white stone. </p> 
  <p> If we link the same color stones which are neighbourhood (|x1-x2| + |y1-y2| = 1), we can get some connected component.<br> We say a connected component is dead if no stone in it has an empty neighbourhood cell.</p> 
  <p> In each move, the player must put the stone on an empty cell or pass the turn. If this player put a stone, following situation will<br> happen. </p> 
  <ol> 
  </ol> 
  <li>If after this move there is at least one connected component of opponent dead, then stones from these dead components<br> will be removed. (In this case, after remove all dead components of your opponent, we can prove all your connected component are not dead.)</li> 
  <li> Otherwise, if there are at least one connected component of yours dead, then this move is invalid.</li> 
  <p> In order to avoid infinite loops, there is a rule called "No same state". The state of board can be expressed as a string with length 82:<br> the first character indicate who is the next player, then 9*9 character indicate the state of a certain cell. If after one move the game<br> goes into a state that previously occurred, then this move is invalid.<br> </p> 
  <p> You are given an integer N. Please output a match that contains N valid moves for both player. </p> 
  <p> You can find details for the rules in the judge program<br> <a href="https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/RANKA_JUDGE.cpp">here</a>. </p> 
  <h3>Input</h3> 
  <p>Only line of input will contain an integer denoting <b>N</b>.</p> 
  <h3>Output</h3> 
  <p>You must output N lines.<br> If the player uses "pass" at that step, then output "0 0", otherwise output the coordinate "x y" where 1 ≤ x,y ≤ 9. </p> 
  <h3>Constraints and Subtasks</h3> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Subtask1 (20 points) : <b>N = 5000</b></li> 
   <li>Subtask2 (80 points) : <b>N = 10000</b></li> 
  </ul>
