  <p>A galaxy is a set of planets with some connections between pairs of planets. Connections between planets are mutual and no planet can be connected with itself. The distance between a pair of planets is the least number of connections that you have to pass through while travelling from the first planet to the second.</p> 
  <p>Now let's consider how good galaxies are formed.</p> 
  <p>Initially there is a galaxy that consists of exactly one planet. At any moment, the galaxy grows by first making a copy of itself; then connecting each planet in the first copy to the corresponding planet in the second copy. Thus a galaxy which has <b>P</b> planets and <b>M</b> connections would grow into a new galaxy with <b>2P</b> planets and <b>2M+P</b> connections.</p> 
  <p>This diagram shows how the galaxy grows over the first two iterations. Dark grey shows the copy of the galaxy; light grey shows the additional connections.</p>

  <p>However, galaxies do not continue growing forever. Why? The answer is simple: comets. At any point after the galaxy has started growing, a comet may pass through the galaxy. When it does, it changes the connections between planets by the following rule:</p> 
  <p><em>Two planets are connected after the comet arrives if and only if the distance between the planets was equal to 2 before the comet arrives.</em></p> 
  <p>It can be shown that a comet will split a growing galaxy into two disconnected galaxies with identical structures.</p> 
  <p>After a comet has arrived, the galaxy stops growing. Researchers have discovered that each of the two identical galaxies formed by the comet are 'good galaxies' - fit for living. In fact, galaxies formed in this way are the <em>only</em> good galaxies that exist.</p> 
  <p>This diagram shows the result when a comet arrives after each of the first three iterations. In each one the red and blue colours show the two equivalent good galaxies.</p> 
  <p><img height="123" width="329" src="/download/extimages/55bf4f46313dbc1cff5ebbd214e35142.png"></p> 
  <p>Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever. For many reasons, such as a second comet appearing, new planets or connections between them may be created or destroyed, resulting in galaxies with many other structures and causing the galaxy to lose its 'good' status.</p> 
  <p>You are given a galaxy with <b>N</b> planets and <b>M</b> connections. Your task is to determine whether this galaxy is a good galaxy - ie can be created by a comet passing through a growing galaxy.</p> 
  <h3>Input</h3> 
  <p>The first line of the input contains one integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.</p> 
  <p>The first line of each test case contains two integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b> - the number of planets in the galaxy and the number of connections. All planets are enumerated from 1 to <b>N</b>.</p> 
  <p>The following <b>M</b> lines each contain a pair of different integers - two planets which are connected in the galaxy. It's guaranteed that there won't be multiple connections between any pair of planets.</p> 
  <h3>Output</h3> 
  <p>For each test case output one word per line: "YES" if the galaxy is a good galaxy, or "NO" if it is not.</p> 
  <h3>Constraints</h3> 
  <ul> 
   <li><b>1</b> ≤ <b>T</b> ≤ <b>5</b></li> 
   <li><b>2</b> ≤ <b>N</b> ≤ <b>1024</b></li> 
   <li><b>0</b> ≤ <b>M</b> ≤ <b>40 000</b></li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Subtasks</h3> 
  <ul> 
   <b>Subtask #1 </b> [22 points]: 
   <b>N</b> ≤ 
   <b>32</b> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <b>Subtask #2</b> [78 points]: maximum constraints

  <h3>Explanation</h3> 
  <p><b>Test case 1.</b> This galaxy is equivalent to the red (or blue) galaxy in step 2 in the above image.</p> 
  <p><b>Test case 2.</b> This galaxy is similar to test case 1, but the connection has been destroyed, so the galaxy is no longer good.</p> 
  <p><b>Test case 3.</b> There are no good galaxies with 3 planets; some planets must have been destroyed.</p>
