  <h3>Problem Statement</h3> 
  <p>Chef is at a mountain range . There are N mountains lined up in a straight line . Each mountain has a height h[i] . Chef is currently at mountain a and wants to go to mountain b . He can do so by jumping from mountain a to b (he is talented ) . But he can jump from a to b only if there is no mountain between a and b whose height is strictly greater than that of mountain a .</p> 
  <p>In this problem , you will be given the array h containing heights of mountains and several queries with a and b , you will have you answer whether chef can jump from a to b or not . </p> 
  <h3>Input</h3> 
  <p>The first line contains an integer N, the next line has N integers denoting the heights of the mountains h[i] . The next line has an integer Q , the number of queries , Then q lines follow each containing 2 integers a and b.</p> 
  <h3>Output</h3> 
  <p>For each query , answer "YES" if chef can jump from a to b , otherwise answer "NO" if he cant . </p> 
  <h3>Constraints</h3> 
  <ul> 
   <li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>N</b> &lt;= <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li> 
   <li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>h[i]</b> &lt;= <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li> 
   <li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>Q</b> &lt;= <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li> 
   <li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>a</b> &lt;= <b>N</b></li> 
   <li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>b</b> &lt;= <b>N</b></li> 
   <li><b>b&gt;a</b></li> 
  </ul> 
  <h3>Example</h3> 
  <pre><b>Input:</b>
5
2 3 1 2 4

1 3
2 5
2 3
<b>Output:</b>
NO
YES
YES

  <h3>Explaination</h3> 
  <p>For first query the answer is NO because between 1 and 3 , the second mountain is of height 3 which is more than height of mountain 1 which is 2 . For second query there is no mountain more than 3 units high between 2 and 5 so answer is YES. For 3rd query there is no mountain between 2 and 3 so the answer is YES .</p>
