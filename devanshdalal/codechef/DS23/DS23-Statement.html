There were many confusing paths to complete this task, but Bob decided to pass labyrinth from the shortest path. Now your task is to help Bob by finding the shortest path from top left corner to right bottom corner of labyrinth.</p> 
  <h3>Input: </h3> 
  <p> First line contains number of rows(N) in Labyrinth, after this line, each of next N lines describe a row of labyrinth. There will be no more than 80 columns and no more than 80 rows and shape of labyrinth must be rectangular (not necessarily a square).<br><br> Each position of the row is one of two characters. A '0' means you may move onto that position. A '1' means that space is occupied by a wall. You are allowed to move in any direction (up, down, left, right, diagonal) provided that the square you move into isn't a '1'. You always start in the upper left hand corner of the Labyrinth. The exit is always at the lower right hand corner of the labyrinth. There will always be at least one path from top left corner to bottom right corner.<br> <br></p>
