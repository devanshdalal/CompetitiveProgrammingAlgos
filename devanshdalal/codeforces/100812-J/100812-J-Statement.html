   <p>I was tired. Tired of hiding and wandering. Throw the rules out the window, odds are you'll go that way too. I just wanted everything to be finished. The crying heavens had already given a verdict for me, I was just looking for somebody to execute it. The castle of Dragon was not defenseless, it was ready for my visit. The beast inside me was woking up and rubbing his eyes.</p>
   <p>I had already known every single bandit guarding Dragon's castle. It was quite useful to have connections in knight orders. There were only <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> men there. There had been some bigger frays. And not all of them desperately wanted to die by my hand that night. I knew that the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th of them would have decided to fight only if at least <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> other bandits had decided the same. I was slowly approaching the gates, wondering what was the maximal number of people who might have opposed me.</p>
