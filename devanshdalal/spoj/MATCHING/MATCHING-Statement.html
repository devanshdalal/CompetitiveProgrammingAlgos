<p>FJ has N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50,000) cows and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 50,000) bulls. Given a list of P (1 ≤ P ≤ 150,000) potential matches between a cow and a bull, compute the greatest number of pairs that can be matched. Of course, a cow can be matched to at most one bull, and vice versa.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>The first line contains three integers, N, M, and P. Each of the next P lines contains two integers A (1 ≤ A ≤ N) and B (1 ≤ B ≤ M), denoting that cow A can be matched with bull B.</p> 
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>Print a single integer that is the maximum number of pairs that can be obtained.</p> 
<h3>Example</h3>
