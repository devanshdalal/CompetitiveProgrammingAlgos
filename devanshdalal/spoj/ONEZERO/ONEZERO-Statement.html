<p>Certain positive integers have their decimal representation consisting only of ones and zeros, and having at least one digit one, e.g. 101. If a positive integer does not have such a property, one can try to multiply it by some positive integer to find out whether the product has this property. </p>
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>Number <i>K</i> of test cases (<i>K</i> is approximately 1000);<br> in each of the next <i>K</i> lines there is one integer <i>n</i> (<i>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20000)</i><br> </p>
<h3>Output</h3> 
<p>For each test case, your program should compute the smallest multiple of the number <i>n</i> consisting only of digits 1 and 0 (beginning with 1). </p>
