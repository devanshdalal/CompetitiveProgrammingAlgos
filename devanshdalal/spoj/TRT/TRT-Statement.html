<p>FJ has purchased N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 2000) yummy treats for the cows who get money for giving vast amounts of milk. FJ sells one treat per day and wants to maximize the money he receives over a given period time. The treats are interesting for many reasons: </p> 
<ul> 
 <li> The treats are numbered 1..N and stored sequentially in single file in a long box that is open at both ends. On any day, FJ can retrieve one treat from either end of his stash of treats. </li> 
 <li>Like fine wines and delicious cheeses, the treats improve with age and command greater prices.</li> 
 <li>The treats are not uniform: some are better and have higher intrinsic value. Treat i has value v(i) (1 &lt;= v(i) &lt;= 1000). </li> 
 <li>Cows pay more for treats that have aged longer: a cow will pay v(i)*a for a treat of age a. </li> 
</ul> 
<p>Given the values v(i) of each of the treats lined up in order of the index i in their box, what is the greatest value FJ can receive for them if he orders their sale optimally? </p> 
<p>The first treat is sold on day 1 and has age a=1. Each subsequent day increases the age by 1.</p> 
<h3>Input</h3> 
<p>Line 1: A single integer, N</p> 
<p>Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the value of treat v(i)</p> 
<h3>Output</h3>
